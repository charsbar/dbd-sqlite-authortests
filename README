DBD-SQLite-AuthorTests

This is a collection of author tests that I'm not willing to add to the main DBD::SQLite repository. This is not meant to be installed via CPAN clients; just clone this from the repository (github), checkout/export DBD::SQLite under a subdirectory of the directory where you cloned this (if necessary), run C<perl Makefile.PL && make && make test>, and see what happens.
